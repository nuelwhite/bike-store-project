# Bike Store Project üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hello there! üëã. Welcome. This is my data analysis project :mag: based on data from a store that sell bicycles :bike:. 
I performed an exploration data analysis on the data to uncover insights :mag:. This file provides a brief report of some the insights uncovered.

## Introduction
Data analysis is the process of finiding, collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to make informed decisions. These decisions are backed by solid inights uncovered through the analysis. As data analysts, it is very important to bring your A-Game always to every project because, loosing focus for a minute might cause unreliable insights. But whatever, The business store collects customer data when they come into the store to enquire or purchase a bike. 

Based on this data collected, I performed an exploration analysis, and uncovered certain insights that will be shared in this report :book:. They collect data about sales, whether customers have bought bicycles or not; where the customers live; if the customers are married; how many kids they have; their commute distance to work; and other information per the company‚Äôs data policy.

One major benefit of data analysis is the power to derive insights from data. Data from which you would think no decision can be derived from. But harnessing the power of data analysis can guide you to make informed decisions from the data you analyze. 

## Tools :computer: 
In this project I used Microsoft Excel as my analysis tool. Excel is a powerful tool for analysis. It has loads and lots of analytical functions that help in analyzing data. It has great features that enable visualization. Incredible charts, and Pivot Tables that allow an analyst to group data and analyze them.

## Analysis
### 1. What is the Gender distribution of customers segment?
   There are 1000 distinct data in the dataset. 511 of the customers were Males :man:, contributing to 51.1% of the entries. And There are 489 customers which are Females :woman:, also constributing to 48.9% of the total entries.

### 2. How many Male, or Female customers bought or did not buy a bike?
   I found that 51.90% percent of the customers that came to the store did not buy a bike. 25% of them were females and 26.90% were male demographics. 48.10% of the customers bought a bike, and 24.20% were males whereas 23.90% were females. 
We can deduce that majority of the customers were enquirers, and majority were Males with 269 customers to 250 for the Females. And majority of our sales were from Males with 242 sales with 239 for Females.
